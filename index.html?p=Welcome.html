			<i>'The Lord has done great things for them.<br>
			The Lord has done great things for us,<br>
			and we are filled with joy.'</i> -Psalms 126:2b-3 NIV
			</p>
			<p>
			The word "done" in this context is "bara" in Hebrew
			which means to create something from nothing, which
			is only God's job.  Another definition for "done" is
			"asawh" in Hebrew which means redefined from something
			already created; to transform<font color=red>*</font>.
			God does this too,
			and so do we: that is what I have done here for
			viewing pleasure!!
			<p><b>All for the glory of our Creator, who gives all things.</b></p>
			<font color=red>*</font> these notes are
			derived from a conference I attended of which Beth Moore
			spoke.<br><br><br>
			The following quote is one that means a lot to me, and reflects what it is I desire to do: create and enjoy beautiful things.  But I want to emphasize that all true beauty is found in One that goes before us, giving us wisdom and discernment, enabling us to create lovely environments filled with hopefully more than just nice belongings.<br/>
