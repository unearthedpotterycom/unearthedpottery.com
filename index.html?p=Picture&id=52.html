			Dimensions: 24 X 18.5 inches with black matte, This is a photo montage made Spring 2003 in my Photoshop class in college.  It was one of five images that were a part of my senior art show, Spring 2004.  They were projected onto five ceramic platters that I made with a clear glaze on them so the images would show up clearly in a darkened room.  The platters were placed on a table top that I painted with red, emotive strokes, with poems and songs written on it, with sand covering some of the table to symbolize the many different layers of life and images projected in space. <br/> <br/><br/> *click on image to enlarge*<br><br>
