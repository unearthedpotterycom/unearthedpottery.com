			This room was transformed in 2008, when I worked at La-Z-Boy as an In-Home Designer.  I was paired up with a Sales Associate and "interviewed" the client in their home, and measured the space for a whole room design, not merely one piece of furniture.  A floor plan was included and presentation of furniture from many different vendors was performed.  This client had us design fully 3 rooms of their home.  They had just moved in and the rooms were empty when we started the project (as seen below).<br/> <br/><br/> *click on image to enlarge*<br><br>
