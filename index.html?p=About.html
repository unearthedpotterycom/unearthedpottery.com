A native of Northern Virginia, Bethany (Good) Cropsey grew up with
a love of art and color. Bethany's passion for creativity and design
led her to Eastern Mennonite University, where she earned a BA in
Visual Arts with a minor in Psychology. A semester spent in the Middle East, Egypt, Greece & Italy gave her greater insights into other places as well as her own. Following her graduation,
Bethany spent a year on St John in the US Virgin Islands as a
potter. Her experience there included teaching classes to locals and
guests of the eco-tourist resort of Maho Bay Campground. Bethany's
sculpture entitled "From One" received the People's Choice Award from
the Mango Tango gallery on St Thomas, and her functional and
sculptural works were sold on several islands including St John, St Thomas (USVI), and Tortola (BVI). Bethany also spent several months in Namibia, southern Africa, where she gained inspiration from the pastoral, indigenous cultures.  For the time being, Bethany is settled with her husband Gabe in Reston, Virginia, and is currently pursuing a Master's Degree in
Interior Design from Marymount University. In her free time, Bethany
enjoys all sorts of artistic endeavors, including making jewelry, interior decorating, collaging, painting, sewing, and photography. The variety of Bethany's travels, experiences & experiementation gives her work a dimensional and unique appeal.<br/><br/><b>If you have any questions regarding her artwork on this site, or would like to inquire about pricing, availability or sizing, please contact:
